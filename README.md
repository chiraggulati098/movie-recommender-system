# Collaborative Based Recommender System for Movies

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a Collaborative Based Recommender System for Movies. The system will analyze user ratings to recommend movies based on their preferences and similar user behavior.

## About Collaborative Based Recommender Systems
Collaborative Based Recommender Systems analyze user interactions and preferences to generate recommendations. They can be user-based or item-based, where user-based systems recommend items based on similar users' preferences, while item-based systems recommend items similar to those a user has already liked.

## Dataset
### Dataset Details:
The dataset used for this project is based on the MovieLens 25M Dataset, available at [MovieLens 25M Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/). The dataset has been reduced to include users with only more than 350 movies rated, resulting in over 58,000 movies.

In the future, the project plans to add the option for users to choose multiple likings and receive recommendations based on those preferences.
